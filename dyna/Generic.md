SAFE vibe coding: Secure, Auditable, Fenced-capability, Enterprise-ready

# What this project is

Secure: Closed renderer registry, signed/allowlisted plugins, CSP alignment, runtime validation, kill switches.
Auditable: Structured logs, metrics, tracing, and immutable audit trails for load/mount/unmount and policy decisions.
Fenced-capability: Least privilege by design; narrow, vetted APIs and allowlisted channels; no implicit access to host state or network.
Enterprise-ready: Versioned artifacts with rollback, accessibility and privacy controls, compliance posture, operable in production.

# Short Version

A desktop‑like Canvas inside a browser that can host multiple movable, resizable windows (forms, chat, metadata, etc.).
Each window is rendered by a known adapter from a closed registry (no arbitrary component names).
A new window kind called plugin lets you load UI modules at runtime and treat them as first‑class windows on the Canvas.


# Why this matters

You can add or remove capabilities at runtime without rebuilding the host app.
Plugins are isolated to reduce blast radius and version conflicts.
You keep enterprise guardrails: validation, least privilege, observability, governance, and rollback.

# Core concepts

Canvas: manages the list of windows, focus, z‑order, geometry, and safe close behavior.
Window frame: provides title bar, drag/resize, close/minimize, and theming hooks.
Renderer registry: a fixed mapping from window kind to adapter (form, chat, metadata, plugin). This enforces “declarative, not arbitrary.”
Plugin renderer: a special adapter that dynamically loads a module by id/version, mounts it into the window body, and cleans up on unmount.


# How plugins work (abstracted)

Each plugin is a self‑contained bundle built and deployed separately from the host.
It includes its own framework runtime (React, Vue, Angular, Web Components, etc.) to avoid runtime coupling with the host.

## It exposes a tiny, stable contract:
mountPlugin(target, props) which renders into the provided DOM node and returns an unmount function.
Optional update(props) for efficient prop changes; otherwise the host remounts on change.
A manifest (id, version, URL, checksum, size, allowed flag) for governance and integrity checks.

## The host:
Validates the spawn config (kind, id, version, geometry, props).
Dynamically imports the plugin module from a vetted origin.
Calls mountPlugin with plain props and manages unmounting on window close or remount conditions.
Logs timings, sizes, and errors for observability and audit.

# SAFE guardrails applied

Declarative, not arbitrary: only allowlisted window kinds are renderable via a closed registry. No executing code from untrusted schemas.
Validate everything: schema‑validate spawn configs, props, and any messages on cross‑window or plugin buses. Use static types where possible plus runtime checks at boundaries.
Least privilege: plugins receive only plain props (and optionally a narrow capability API). No implicit access to host state, controller, or network.
Observability and audit: structured logs for load/mount/unmount/errors, metrics for latency and failure rates, trace IDs per window, immutable audit trail of “who loaded what and when.”
Accessibility and inclusion: standard window keyboard model, focus management, and contrast rules; a published a11y checklist for plugins and pre‑publish checks.
Versioning and migration: plugins are versioned by URL; manifests include checksums; rollback is a version change.
Kill switches and feature flags: per plugin id/version allowlist and kill switch for rapid disablement.
Privacy and compliance: classify data carried in props, redact logs, retain per policy, require consent for telemetry, and align with CSP (same‑origin recommended).


# Key trade‑offs vs static, first‑class components

## Dev experience:
No host hot‑reload for dynamically imported modules.
Weaker compile‑time typing across the boundary.
Mitigations: cache‑busting in dev, tiny plugin‑only dev server, one‑liner rebuild; define a versioned plugin contract and validate at runtime.

## Runtime integration:
No shared host context/store; plugins are isolated on purpose.
Prop updates may require remount unless the plugin exposes update.
First‑open latency and larger payloads because each plugin includes its runtime.
Mitigations: narrow prop surface, message bus with allowlisted channels, remount‑on‑change for MVP, prefetch popular plugins, keep bundles small.
## Styling and theming:
Plugin CSS is isolated; it won’t automatically adopt host tokens or dark mode.
Mitigations: pass CSS custom properties or design tokens via the window frame; document a theming contract.

## A11y and UX cohesion:
Plugins can drift from host conventions.
Mitigation: publish an a11y/UX checklist and enforce before allowing a plugin.

## Testing and observability:
Harder to e2e as a single build.
Mitigations: contract tests for the plugin API, runtime smoke checks, and strong logging/metrics around import/mount.

## SSR/prerendering:
Plugin content is client‑only.
Mitigation: acceptable for admin tools; render skeletons/fallbacks.

## Caching/deploy:
ESM modules cache by URL; you must bump versions to update in place.
Mitigation: versioned URLs in prod; query‑string cache busters only in dev.

## Inter‑window communication:
No implicit access to other windows.
Mitigation: vetted, typed message bus with size limits and allowlisted channels.

# Plugin contract (framework‑neutral)

## Required:
mountPlugin(target, props) returns unmount() or an object with unmount().

## Optional:
update(props) for in‑place updates.
metadata() for runtime self‑describe (used for diagnostics).
## Manifest fields (served alongside the module):
id, version, module URL, checksum (e.g., SHA‑256), size, allowed flag, permissions requested (if any).

# Host responsibilities

Manage window lifecycle, z‑order, and geometry; persist window state if needed.
Enforce the closed renderer registry and validate spawn configs and props.
Build a safe import URL using id/version from an allowlist; align with CSP and same‑origin policies.
Mount the plugin into a dedicated DOM node; hold and invoke unmount on window close or remount.
Provide theming tokens and an optional narrow capability API (e.g., message bus, telemetry).
Emit structured logs, metrics, and traces for import/mount/unmount; wire kill switches and feature flags.

# Plugin responsibilities

Render only within the provided target DOM node.
Cleanly unmount and release resources.
Avoid relying on host globals or internals; use only provided props/capabilities.
Follow the theming and a11y contracts.
Keep bundle size reasonable; version releases; publish a signed manifest.

# Lifecycle at a glance

Spawn requested with kind=plugin, id, version, props.
Host validates config, logs intent, fetches manifest if used, dynamically imports the module.
Host calls mountPlugin(target, props); plugin renders.
On props change, either host remounts or calls update if available.
On close or replacement, host calls unmount; logs duration and outcomes.

# Cross‑framework implementation hints

React: plugin bundles React and ReactDOM, creates a root in mountPlugin, renders with props, returns unmount. Optional update re‑renders with new props.
Vue: plugin bundles Vue, creates an app in mountPlugin with props, mounts into target, returns unmount. Optional update via exposed method or remount.
Angular: package as a microfrontend or Element; mountPlugin bootstraps into target, returns destroy; updates via Inputs or remount.
Web Components: mountPlugin creates the custom element, sets properties/attributes from props, appends to target, returns a remover; updates by setting properties.

# Developer workflow (typical)

Author the plugin in your chosen framework, adhering to the mountPlugin contract and a11y/theming rules.
Build a self‑contained ESM bundle that includes your framework runtime and exports mountPlugin (and optional update).
Publish bundle and manifest at a versioned path. Prefer same‑origin to simplify CSP and cookies.
Allowlist the plugin id/version in the host; enable behind a feature flag if needed.
Spawn windows with the plugin id/version and props; monitor logs/metrics; roll back by changing the version.

# Troubleshooting (generic)

Module 404: verify the versioned path and server routing.
Mount error: module didn’t export mountPlugin or threw on render; capture and surface a helpful error in the window body.
Stale code: browser cached the module; in prod, bump version; in dev, append a cache‑busting query.
Styling mismatch: ensure host passes design tokens and plugin consumes them; verify dark mode contract.
A11y issues: verify focus order, keyboard shortcuts, labels, and contrast meet the checklist.

# Bottom line

You get runtime extensibility, isolation, and enterprise‑grade guardrails by treating plugins as opaque, versioned UI modules mounted into a controlled windowing surface.
You trade away some DX (hot reload, tight typing) and deep runtime coupling you’d have with static, first‑class components.
For admin consoles and extensible workspaces, this is often the right balance: fast iteration with SAFE controls, clear rollback, and limited blast radius.

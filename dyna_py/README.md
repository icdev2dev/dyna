Modern Async Agent System with Action Queue: Architectural Summary
# Purpose
Design an extensible, observable, and robust system where:

Agents (which may be LLM-driven) process tasks and actions fetched from a queue (e.g., LanceDB).
Actions can affect agents (e.g., create, pause, interrupt) or the environment.
The system can handle agent pausing, resumption, interruption with additional input, and clean state/progress serialization.

# 1. Core Concepts & Data Model
Action Queue Schema
Every action is a record in the queue, e.g.:
action_id (unique string key, for traceability)
type (e.g., "agent_pause", "environment_reload")
created_at, actor (whodunnit and when)
processed (bool)
urgency (for prioritization)
description (LLM-friendly description for embedding/search)
payload and metadata (JSON-serialized: use pa.string() for pyarrow)
Example Python function for action creation:
def create_action(action_type, actor, ...):
    return {
        "action_id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
        "type": action_type,
        "created_at": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "actor": actor,
        "processed": False,
        ... # others
    }
# 2. Action Handling Logic
Queue Watcher
Async loop fetches unprocessed actions from DB.
Example: actions = await poll_lancedb_for_actions()
Each action is dispatched based on type:
Use a dispatch map: ACTION_HANDLERS = {'agent_pause': agent_pause, ...}
Agent Operations
Agents implemented as async classes/coroutines.

Use mixins to add pausing, resuming, and interruptibility or inject new guidance.

class PausableAgent(PauseMixin, AgentBase): ...
class InterruptibleAgent(InterruptMixin, AgentBase): ...
Interrupts
Not cancellation! Interrupt means the agent receives new guidance (e.g. via async queue) and continues with updated instructions.

Agent Loop
Pattern of agent’s .run():

while True:
    state, final_result = await llm_call(state)
    if state.is_final:
        ... # store final_result
        break
    # Non-blocking check for interrupts
    if not interrupt_queue.empty():
        msg = await interrupt_queue.get()
        await handle_interrupt(msg)
# 3. Serialization & State Management
On pause: Serialize only the agent’s operational state (not the coroutine/call stack!) to DB.
On resume: Rehydrate agent with state; start a new async loop.
Use .save_state() and .load_state() methods.
# 4. Schema Guidance For Inputs and Outputs
Interrupt input: Each agent type should declare its expected interrupt data type/schema (e.g., via class attribute or method). Use dataclasses or Pydantic models when needed.

class MyAgent(InterruptMixin, ...):
    interrupt_schema = MyInterruptMsg
Agent output:
Each step emits a structured "step result" (for observation/progress/monitoring); upon completion, agent emits a "FinalResult" object holding the last state, output, any errors, audit/log info, and (optionally) stepwise history.

@dataclass
class StepResult: ...
@dataclass
class FinalResult: ...
# 5. pyarrow & JSON
Store arbitrary JSON in a pa.string() column and serialize/deserialize with json.dumps()/json.loads().
For known/fixed structure, use pa.struct().
# 6. Pandas Tips
To get columns as lists:
result[['action_id', 'type']].values.tolist()  # List of [action_id, type]
To parse JSON from a DataFrame column:
json.loads(result.payload.iloc[0])
# 7. Key Async Techniques
Pause/resume: Use asyncio.Event and check .wait() inside your agent’s run loop.
Interrupt with input: Use an asyncio.Queue for agent to non-blockingly receive guidance/instructions at safe points between steps.
Progress checkpointing: Save agent state after every atomic/LLM/step, so recovery/resume is robust.
# 8. General Code Patterns
Printing { in f-strings: f"{{" yields {
pyarrow bool field: Use pa.bool_(), not pa.bool().
# 9. Architectural Rationale
Separation of concerns: Agents, environments, actions are modular.
Observability and traceability: Fine-grained step outputs, plus clear final contract.
Interruption is cooperative and safe.
Serialization is explicit, not magic (no pickling async stacks).
Schema-first, with explicit guidance for agent input/output contracts.
LLM/text embedding integration via description fields + async embedding jobs.
pyarrow used for columnar storage, but JSON handled as string for flexibility.
# 10. Extensibility & Next Steps
Add more action types and handlers as your system evolves.
Integrate vector embedding for semantic search.
Expand agent observability with custom outputs or event logs.
Implement error/retry/cancellation features as needed.

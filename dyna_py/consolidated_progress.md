Current system snapshot
Architecture
Queue-driven async agents using LanceDB:
Actions are appended to a LanceDB “queue” table (payload/metadata as JSON strings). agents.py runs an async poller/dispatcher that pulls unprocessed actions and invokes async handlers in agent.py. Agents are cooperative via mixins: PauseMixin, InterruptMixin, StopMixin. Each action is marked processed; IN_FLIGHT_ACTION_IDS prevents double-dispatch while a handler is running. Agent runtime and registry

JokeAgent runs in an asyncio.Task; loop checks stop/pause, consumes interrupts, and calls tell_a_joke(subject). JOKE_AGENTS maps agent_id -> instance for lifecycle control (create, pause, resume, interrupt, destroy). Graceful destroy: if paused, resume, then request_stop, await with timeout, cancel if needed, remove from registry. State persistence plumbing

store/agent_state.py provides upsert/get/list; we agreed to use update-then-append (not overwrite). An async wrapper runs sync storage in threads (asyncio.to_thread). We introduced agent_steps (append-only) to record per-iteration history and added list endpoints (details below).

Two entry points
agents.py: long-running async service that polls the queue and dispatches actions. app.py: Flask + Socket.IO app. For real WebSockets, run with socketio.run(app, …), not app.run(). Core components and flow

queue_imp.py (or equivalent store/action_queue): LanceDB connection + schemas; enqueue helpers: agent_create, agent_pause_action, agent_resume_action, agent_interrupt, agent_destroy_action; mark_action_processed_async. agent_core.py: AgentBase, InterruptMixin (asyncio.Queue), PauseMixin (asyncio.Event), StopMixin (asyncio.Event). All mixins call super().init to ensure proper initialization. agent.py: Handlers have signature (db, async_tbl, action). Handlers mark actions processed in finally to avoid stuck actions. Dispatcher spawns a task per action; closure variables must be bound (run_one(aid=aid, action=action, handler=handler)) to avoid late-binding bugs. joke_agent.py: Loop respects pause/stop, consumes interrupt guidance (updates current_subject), prints joke, sleeps ~3s. Calls async state_updater and steps_appender (closures injected at create) to persist.

Assessments and fixes
Lifecycle and robustness
Cooperative pause/resume/stop are in place. agent_destroy was fixed and now persists status (stopping -> stopped) without crashing.

State handling
upsert_agent_state must be update-then-append; do not use add(mode="overwrite"). get_agent_state should safely parse JSON fields; if result is plain text (not JSON), return as-is (avoid JSONDecodeError). Async wrappers use asyncio.to_thread to keep event loop responsive.

Dispatcher and handlers
Agent interrupt must always mark the action processed even on bad payloads (use try/finally). Bind loop variables in run_one to avoid late-binding hazards and catch/print exceptions (prevents “Task exception was never retrieved” noise).

Poller and ordering
Current cadence is slow (effectively ~15s). Improve by reducing sleep and ordering by created_at (and optionally urgency). WebSockets

Use socketio.run(app, …) for proper WS. Consider emitting per-step events to clients.

LanceDB semantics
append adds rows; overwrite replaces the entire table. For agent_state, use update-then-append; for agent_steps and queue, use append; use update to mark queue processed.

Moniker model and runner pattern
Why “moniker”
Encapsulates the task-specific step function (tell_a_joke, summarize, research) with a stable I/O contract; the runner (agent) handles orchestration.

StepFrame-v0 contract (MVP)
Input to moniker: { step, state, guidance? } Output from moniker: { step, next_step, state, text?, data?, done, notes? } We decided: Keep both step and iteration. They serve different purposes. step/next_step are strings (tokens) to support hierarchical/named cursors (e.g., “4.2”, “review/1”). iteration is the runner’s monotonically increasing int for ordering/pagination/ops and is not part of the moniker contract.

Runner loop
Maintain step_token: str and iteration: int. Each loop: build frame_in with step_token/state/guidance_once -> call moniker -> parse frame_out. Persist: agent_state snapshot: status, iteration, step_token, next_step_token, result, context. agent_steps history: append iteration, step_token, next_step_token, text, data, state, guidance, notes, status. If out.done and stop_on_done=true: exit; else continue with step_token = out.next_step; iteration += 1. Add safeguards: max_steps and/or max_runtime_s.

BAML function
We generalized the “joke” moniker to a generic RunMonikerStep(frame, task) returning the StepFrame JSON.

4. Sessions (run/correlation id)
Decisions
Introduce session_id across queue → runtime → agent_state → agent_steps. Prefer client-supplied session_id for idempotency and immediate correlation; server-generated is fine if returned right away. Registries: SESSIONS[session_id] -> agent instance. AGENT_LATEST[agent_id] -> latest session_id for backward-compatible controls by agent_id. Control actions accept session_id; if only agent_id is provided, resolve via AGENT_LATEST.

Data model implications
queue: add session_id; carry through all actions. agent_state: add session_id (nullable initially); upsert keyed by (agent_id, session_id) when session_id present; otherwise legacy by agent_id. agent_steps: include session_id on every row (append-only). HTTP/UI: filter by session_id and/or agent_id; stream by session_id room/topic.

Rehydration
On restart, read agent_state rows with status in {running, paused}, recreate agents with saved state/session_id, resume with step_token=next_step_token and iteration+1.

5. Agent steps (append-only history)
Schema (in LanceDB)
id, created_at, agent_id, session_id (nullable at first), iteration (int), step_token (str), next_step_token (str), status, text, data (JSON string), state (JSON string), guidance (JSON string), notes, latency_ms, error. Store helpers and endpoints

append_agent_step(...) (sync) + append_step_async wrapper. list_agent_steps filters: session_id/agent_id/min/max iteration/since_created_at/status, ordering by iteration asc, limit/offset; JSON decoding of fields. list_agent_steps_since_iteration(session_id, after_iteration). list_agent_steps_latest(session_id|agent_id). HTTP example: GET /api/agent-steps?session_id=... or ?agent_id=.... Sessions listing per agent

list_sessions_for_agent(agent_id): returns distinct sessions with latest snapshot if agent_state has session_id; else falls back to agent_steps grouping. HTTP example: GET /api/agents/<agent_id>/sessions.

6. Conversations as a first-class component
Rationale
Multiple agents (each with multiple sessions) and users participate in a shared thread. Agents deposit interim/final outputs to a conversation; users post messages that can guide agents.

Data model
conversations: conversation_id, title, created_by, status, tags, created_at. conversation_participants: link conversation_id to user_id or (agent_id, session_id), with roles and join/leave times. conversation_messages (append-only): message_id, conversation_id, created_at, sender_type, user_id/agent_id/session_id, text, data, status, event_type, iteration, step_token, next_step_token, notes. Optional session_cursors for agents that pull messages. Agent participation

On create_agent, accept conversation_id; register the session as a participant and bind conversation_id to state_updater/steps_appender closures. On each loop, in addition to agent_state/agent_steps, append a conversation_message with sender_type="agent". On user POST to conversation, append message and enqueue agent_interrupt/agent_input actions targeting participant sessions (push model); or support pull via cursors. HTTP endpoints (minimal)

POST /api/conversations (create), GET /api/conversations (list). POST /api/conversations/{id}/participants, GET /api/conversations/{id}/participants. POST /api/conversations/{id}/messages (user posts), GET /api/conversations/{id}/messages (list transcript).

7. Notable implementation decisions and patterns
Persist JSON fields as strings in LanceDB columns; parse defensively (safe_json_loads). Use update-then-append for upserts; never overwrite an entire table unintentionally. Always mark queue actions processed in finally to avoid stuck rows. Use asyncio.to_thread for sync LanceDB operations from async handlers. Prefer ULID or created_at ordering for human timelines; iteration for precise session-local ordering. Emit Socket.IO events keyed by session_id and/or conversation_id for real-time UI. On error in handlers, persist last_error/status="error" in agent_state and append an error event to agent_steps.

8. Roadmap and verification plan
Step 1: Introduce agent_steps (done/in progress)
Create table and append per iteration. Add list_agent_steps HTTP endpoint; test pagination and ordering. No change to agent_state yet.

Step 2: Introduce session_id end-to-end
Extend queue payloads and schema to carry session_id (accept client-supplied UUID). Extend agent_state with session_id; switch upsert to (agent_id, session_id) when present. Modify agent_create to accept/generate session_id; store in instance; bind into state_updater/steps_appender closures. Add SESSIONS and AGENT_LATEST registries; modify control handlers to accept session_id (resolve if only agent_id is provided). Verify: GET /api/agents/<agent_id>/sessions shows distinct sessions; GET /api/agent-steps?session_id=... returns timeline.

Step 3: Switch moniker to StepFrame-v0
Update BAML to RunMonikerStep(frame, task) returning JSON with step/next_step text tokens and state. Update runner loop to use step_token/next_step_token; persist into agent_state and agent_steps. Add stop_on_done option per agent/moniker and max_steps guard. Verify: outputs still flow; step tokens appear; iteration monotonic; done semantics work.

Step 4: Conversations
Add conversations, participants, messages tables + HTTP endpoints. Update agent_create to accept conversation_id and register participant. On each agent loop, also append conversation_message with agent output. Implement user POST to conversation -> enqueue agent_input/interrupt to participant sessions. Verify: messages appear in transcript; agents react to user posts through queue.

Step 5: Rehydration and ops
On startup, rehydrate running/paused sessions from agent_state; resume with step_token=next_step_token and iteration+1. Improve poller responsiveness and ordering (created_at asc, urgency). Replace app.run with socketio.run; emit session/conversation events for UI. Error handling: capture exceptions in handlers and persist status="error", last_error; retry policies where appropriate. Table bootstrap: ensure schemas are created lazily or on startup.

9. Open items and options
Choose UUID vs ULID for ids (ULID helps natural ordering). Decide default stop_on_done per moniker (continuous vs finite workflows). Decide when to make session_id required in agent_state and agent_steps (initially nullable for migration). Optionally add agent_config table for per-agent/moniker parameters. Consider agent_steps event_seq if you plan partial/streamed events within the same iteration.

What we have built
Architecture: Async agents driven by a LanceDB-backed action queue.
Actions are written to table "queue" (JSON payload/metadata stored as strings).
agents.py runs a queue watcher that polls unprocessed actions and dispatches to async handlers in agent.py.
Agents are cooperative: they support pause, resume, interrupts (new guidance), and graceful stop.
Each action is marked processed after handling to avoid reprocessing.
Two entry points:
app.py: Flask + Socket.IO server (note: for real WebSocket support, run with socketio.run(app, ...) instead of app.run()).
agents.py: long-running async process that polls the queue and dispatches actions to create/control agents.
Core components and flow
queue_imp.py
Defines LanceDB connection, schemas for agents_config and queue.
Helpers to enqueue actions:
agent_create(agent_id, actor, initial_subject)
agent_pause_action(agent_id, actor, reason)
agent_resume_action(agent_id, actor)
agent_interrupt(agent_id, actor, guidance)
agent_destroy_action(agent_id, actor, reason)
mark_action_processed_async(async_tbl, action_id): sets processed=True.
agents.py
Connects to LanceDB asynchronously, opens the queue table. queue_watcher loops and calls poll_lancedb_for_actions, then handle_actions. handle_actions dispatches via ACTION_HANDLERS and tracks IN_FLIGHT_ACTION_IDS to prevent double-dispatch while a handler is still running.

agent.py
Action handlers (all with signature (db, async_tbl, action)):
create_agent: creates a JokeAgent if not present, launches its run loop, stores task handle on agent, marks action processed.
agent_pause: pauses the agent and marks processed.
agent_resume: resumes the agent and marks processed.
agent_interrupt: pushes guidance onto the agent’s interrupt queue and marks processed.
agent_destroy: cooperative stop; resumes if paused, requests stop, awaits task with timeout, cancels if needed, removes from registry, marks processed.
environment_reload: calls environment.reload and marks processed.
JOKE_AGENTS is the in-memory registry (agent_id -> agent).
agent_core.py (mixins)
AgentBase: stores agent_id; must call super().init.
InterruptMixin: asyncio.Queue for cooperative interrupts (interrupt/check_interrupt).
PauseMixin: asyncio.Event for pause/resume (pause/resume/wait_if_paused/is_paused).
StopMixin: asyncio.Event for cooperative stop (request_stop/should_stop).
Important: every class in this MRO calls super().init(*args, **kwargs) so all mixin initializers run. We fixed AttributeError by ensuring super().init everywhere.
joke_agent.py
JokeAgent inherits StopMixin, PauseMixin, InterruptMixin, AgentBase.
Loop: If should_stop: break. await wait_if_paused. If should_stop: break. check_interrupt; if dict with "subject", update current_subject. await tell_a_joke(current_subject) via baml; print. await asyncio.sleep(3). Stores _task (the asyncio Task running run()) for clean shutdown.
Step 1 achieved (and steady)
queue_imp.agent_create writes a create_agent action. agents.py watcher picks it up, agent_create launches JokeAgent. agent_interrupt writes an interrupt action; JokeAgent consumes guidance and changes subject on next cycle. Actions are marked processed so they don’t re-run.

Fixes and improvements we implemented
Cooperative pausing/resuming with PauseMixin and checks in run loop.
Cooperative stopping with StopMixin; agent_destroy handler uses it and cleans up the task.
Correct super().init across the MRO to initialize mixins (fixes _pause_event error).
In-flight action tracking to avoid duplicate dispatches while a handler is running.
Standardized handler signatures to (db, async_tbl, action), and each marks action in a finally block.
Persisting agent state (for UI/observability)
We already have store/agent_state.py with:
upsert_agent_state(agent_id, status, iteration, result, context, history) get_agent_state(agent_id) list_agent_states()

Change recommended: upsert_agent_state should not use tbl.add(..., mode="overwrite").
Replace with update-then-append semantics: Try tbl.update(where=f"agent_id == '{agent_id}'", updates=updates). If count == 0, tbl.add([{"agent_id": agent_id, ...}], mode="append"). How we wire runtime to persist state: In agent_create, pass a state_updater (async closure) into the agent, and write an initial state row (status="running", iteration=0, subject, paused=False). In JokeAgent.run: After each step, call state_updater with status="running", iteration=step, result=last joke, current_subject. On interrupt, update pending guidance/subject. On stop, update status="stopped" and ended time. In pause/resume/interrupt/destroy handlers, upsert current status flags for the agent (paused running/stopped etc.). Because store functions are sync, call them via asyncio.to_thread in an upsert_state_async wrapper to keep the event loop responsive.

How to test the lifecycle end-to-end
Start the queue watcher:

python -m agents (or however you run agents.py) Create an agent:

from queue_imp import agent_create agent_create("agent1", "user", initial_subject="cats") Watch: JokeAgent starts printing jokes about cats. Send an interrupt:

from queue_imp import agent_interrupt agent_interrupt("agent1", "user", {"subject": "dogs"}) Watch: logs say it switched subject; subsequent jokes are about dogs. Pause/resume:

from queue_imp import agent_pause_action, agent_resume_action agent_pause_action("agent1", "user", "demo pause") agent_resume_action("agent1", "user") Watch: output stalls during pause, resumes after. Destroy:

from queue_imp import agent_destroy_action agent_destroy_action("agent1", "user", reason="demo") Watch: cooperative stop and cleanup; no further logs. Inspect state (for UI):

from store.agent_state import list_agent_states print(list_agent_states()) You should see one row per agent_id with updated status/iteration/result/context.

Notes and gotchas
WebSockets in app.py: use socketio.run(app, ...) instead of app.run(...) if you rely on Socket.IO handlers. Poll cadence: poll_lancedb_for_actions has a 5s sleep and only fetches every 3rd call (effectively ~15s). Tweak for responsiveness. Always mark actions processed in a finally block to prevent stuck actions. Make sure the LanceDB tables exist (schemas.create_* helpers or lazy-create on startup). payload and metadata fields are JSON strings in pa.string() columns (serialize with json.dumps, parse with json.loads).

What’s ready now
Queue-driven agent creation, interrupt, pause/resume, destroy. Cooperative lifecycle (no abrupt cancels unless destroy timeout triggers). State persistence hooks (once upsert_agent_state is switched to update-then-append and wired as described).

Recommended next steps
Finalize upsert_agent_state patch (remove mode="overwrite"). Add an HTTP endpoint to list agent states for the web UI (wrap store.agent_state.list_agent_states()). Add optional agent_steps history table for step-level observability and timelines. On process restart, rehydrate: read agent_state rows for status="running"/"paused" and recreate agents with saved operational state. Prioritization: respect action.urgency and created_at ordering in poller/dispatcher. Retries and error handling: capture exceptions in handlers and write status="error" with last_error.

Quick reference of handler contract and payloads
create_agent: payload {"agent_id": str, "initial_subject": str?} agent_pause: payload {"agent_id": str, "reason": str?} agent_resume: payload {"agent_id": str} agent_interrupt: payload {"agent_id": str, "guidance": dict} agent_destroy: payload {"agent_id": str, "reason": str?} environment_reload: payload depends on action; current handler just forwards action. If you want, I can provide a small patch set next session:

The upsert_agent_state update-then-insert change. An async wrapper and agent injection of state_updater. A /api/agents endpoint to return list_agent_states() for your UI.

Can you please help with consolidating the discussion above without loosing any details from both of the discussions?


assistant



Reasoning
We need to produce a consolidated document summarizing architecture, components, fixes, next steps, preserving details. Provide organized sections. Probably include diagrams? Just text. Provide thorough summary.
Below is a single, comprehensive reference that merges every point from the two previous discussion threads.
Everything you have built, the design decisions that were taken, the bugs that were fixed, the data‑model changes that are still pending, and the roadmap for the next work‑items are captured in one place – so you can copy‑paste it into a README.md, design doc, or internal wiki without losing any nuance.

1. High‑level Architecture
+-------------------+          +-------------------+          +-------------------+
|  Flask + SocketIO | <---->   |   agents.py       | <---->   |  LanceDB tables   |
|  (app.py)         |  WS/HTTP | (async watcher)   |  queue   |  queue, agents_   |
|  UI & API        |          |  poll → dispatch  |          |  config, state,   |
+-------------------+          +-------------------+          |  steps, convo…   |
                                                               +-------------------+

Action Queue (LanceDB table queue) – every request that wants an agent to do something is stored here as a row.
Columns: action_id, agent_id, action_type, payload (JSON string), metadata (JSON string), processed (bool), created_at, urgency, session_id (future).

Queue watcher (agents.py) – an async long‑running process that:

Opens the queue table with an async LanceDB connection.
Periodically (poll_lancedb_for_actions) pulls unprocessed rows ordered by created_at (and later by urgency).
Dispatches each row to a handler defined in agent.py.
Tracks “in‑flight” action IDs to avoid double‑dispatch while a handler is still running.
Marks the row processed=True in a finally block so no action ever stays stuck.
Flask + SocketIO (app.py) – the HTTP / WebSocket front‑end.

Important: run with socketio.run(app, …) (not app.run()) to enable true WebSockets.
Provides UI‑friendly endpoints (list agents, steps, sessions, conversations) and emits events keyed by session_id / conversation_id.
Agent runtime – each logical agent lives in memory in the JOKE_AGENTS registry (agent_id → JokeAgent instance).

The registry is manipulated only by the queue‑watcher handlers (create, pause, resume, interrupt, destroy).
Agents are cooperative: they expose pause, resume, interrupt, and stop primitives via mixins (see §2).
2. Core Code Modules
Module	Responsibility	Key Public Symbols
queue_imp.py	LanceDB connection & table schemas; helpers that enqueue actions (agent_create, agent_pause_action, …) and mark processed (mark_action_processed_async).	agent_create(), agent_pause_action(), agent_resume_action(), agent_interrupt(), agent_destroy_action(), mark_action_processed_async()
agents.py	Async daemon that watches the queue, pulls rows, and dispatches to handlers.	poll_lancedb_for_actions(), handle_actions(), IN_FLIGHT_ACTION_IDS, ACTION_HANDLERS
agent.py	Handlers that react to each action type. They receive (db, async_tbl, action) and always mark the action processed in a finally clause.	create_agent(), agent_pause(), agent_resume(), agent_interrupt(), agent_destroy(), environment_reload()
agent_core.py	Mix‑in classes that give every agent pause, interrupt, stop capabilities. All mixins call super().__init__ so MRO works correctly.	AgentBase, InterruptMixin, PauseMixin, StopMixin
joke_agent.py	Example concrete agent (JokeAgent) that uses the mixins. It runs a loop that: <br>1️⃣ checks should_stop <br>2️⃣ respects pause <br>3️⃣ consumes pending interrupt guidance (e.g. new subject) <br>4️⃣ calls the BAML tell_a_joke moniker <br>5️⃣ sleeps ~3 s <br>6️⃣ persists state via injected state_updater and step_appender.	JokeAgent
store/agent_state.py	Persistence helpers for the agent‑state table (snapshot of each agent). Current implementation uses tbl.add(..., mode="overwrite") – needs to be changed to “update‑then‑append”.	upsert_agent_state(), get_agent_state(), list_agent_states()
store/agent_steps.py (future)	Append‑only history of every iteration/step (iteration, step token, text, data, latency, …).	append_agent_step(), list_agent_steps()
store/conversation_*.py (future)	Tables + helpers for conversations, participants, and message stream.	create_conversation(), add_participant(), append_conversation_message(), list_conversation_messages()
3. Mix‑in Cooperative Lifecycle (the “cooperative contract”)
Mixin	Purpose	Public API	How it is used in JokeAgent.run()
InterruptMixin	Queue for guidance (e.g. new subject) that the agent can pull at safe points.	self._interrupt_q = asyncio.Queue() <br> await self.check_interrupt() returns None or a dict.	At the start of each iteration the agent does guidance = await self.check_interrupt() and, if guidance.get('subject'), swaps its internal current_subject.
PauseMixin	Pause / resume flag that blocks the loop without cancelling it.	self._pause_event = asyncio.Event() (set → running, cleared → paused) <br> await self.wait_if_paused()	Inside the loop: await self.wait_if_paused() – this yields until the event is set.
StopMixin	Graceful shutdown request.	self._stop_event = asyncio.Event() <br> self.request_stop() <br> self.should_stop property	At the top of each iteration the agent checks if self.should_stop: break.
Important – every class that inherits any of the mixins must call super().__init__(*args, **kwargs) (or super().init) so that each mixin’s initializer runs. This was the source of the original _pause_event AttributeError and is now fixed.

4. Action Flow – From API → Queue → Agent → Persistence

                • pause / resume / interrupt → calls mixin methods / queues
                • destroy → request_stop → await task → cleanup

               store/agent_state → upsert (snapshot)
               store/agent_steps → append (history)

All handlers wrap their core logic in a try … finally where mark_action_processed_async is called, guaranteeing that the queue row never stays “unprocessed”.

State persistence is currently synchronous (LanceDB Python API). All callers wrap it with asyncio.to_thread (or a thin *_async wrapper) so the event loop stays responsive.

5. State Persistence Details
5.1 Agent‑State Table (snapshot)
Column	Type	Meaning
agent_id	string (PK)	Logical identifier of the agent
status	string	"running", "paused", "stopped", "error"
iteration	int	Monotonically increasing counter (per‑session)
result	string (JSON)	Last output (e.g. joke text)
context	string (JSON)	Arbitrary per‑agent context (subject, guidance, …)
last_error	string (nullable)	Exception trace if status = error
updated_at	timestamp	When this snapshot was written
Current bug: upsert_agent_state uses tbl.add(..., mode="overwrite"). This overwrites the whole table, wiping history.

Fix (update‑then‑append):

def upsert_agent_state(...):
    updates = {...}
    cnt = tbl.update(where=f"agent_id == '{agent_id}'", updates=updates)
    if cnt == 0:                     # row does not exist yet
        tbl.add([{"agent_id": agent_id, **updates}], mode="append")

All callers should use an async wrapper:

async def upsert_state_async(*args, **kwargs):
    await asyncio.to_thread(upsert_agent_state, *args, **kwargs)

5.2 Agent‑Steps Table (append‑only history) – planned
Column	Type	Meaning
id	string (ULID)	Primary key
created_at	timestamp	When the step was recorded
agent_id	string	Owner
session_id	string (nullable)	Correlation id (see §6)
iteration	int	Monotonic per‑session
step_token	string	Logical step identifier (e.g. "0", "1.2")
next_step_token	string	Token for the next iteration
status	string	"running", "paused", "error" …
text	string (JSON)	Human‑readable output (joke text, summary, etc.)
data	string (JSON)	Structured payload from the moniker
state	string (JSON)	Snapshot of the agent's internal state after the step
guidance	string (JSON)	Any interrupt guidance applied on this iteration
notes	string (nullable)	Free‑form debugging notes
latency_ms	int	Time taken for the step
error	string (nullable)	Exception message if this step failed
Helper functions (append_agent_step, list_agent_steps) will be thin wrappers around LanceDB add/query with JSON (de)serialization handled defensively (safe_json_loads).

6. Sessions – Correlating Multiple Agent Lifecycles
Why sessions?
A single logical agent (agent_id) may be instantiated many times (e.g., a user opens several chats).
We need an idempotent, client‑visible correlation ID so UI and logs can group everything that belongs together.
Data‑model changes
Queue rows now carry session_id (UUID/ULID).
Agent‑state rows gain a nullable session_id. Upserts use the composite key (agent_id, session_id) when present, otherwise fallback to legacy agent_id‑only rows.
Agent‑steps rows store session_id.
Conversations (future) will also reference session_id.
Runtime changes
agent_create generates (or receives) a session_id and injects it into the newly created JokeAgent.
The state_updater and step_appender closures capture that session_id so every persisted row is automatically correlated.
Registries:
SESSIONS[session_id] → agent instance (fast lookup for control actions).
AGENT_LATEST[agent_id] → session_id (backwards‑compatible “control by agent_id only”).
Control actions (pause, resume, interrupt, destroy) accept either:

session_id or agent_id.
If only agent_id is supplied, the system resolves the latest session via AGENT_LATEST.
UI / API usage
GET /api/agents/<agent_id>/sessions → list of distinct session_ids with their latest state.
GET /api/agent-steps?session_id=… → timeline for a single conversation.
7. Moniker / Runner Pattern (StepFrame‑v0)
Motivation
Separate business logic (the “moniker” that knows how to tell a joke, summarize, research, etc.) from orchestration (the agent runner that handles pause/interrupt/stop and persistence).

Contract – StepFrame‑v0
{
  "step": "0",                 // current step token (string)
  "next_step": "1",            // token for the following step
  "iteration": 3,              // runner‑provided monotonic int (not part of contract)
  "state": { … },              // arbitrary JSON that the moniker wants to keep
  "text": "Why did the …",     // human‑readable output (optional)
  "data": { … },               // structured payload (optional)
  "done": false,               // true → runner may stop (if stop_on_done)
  "notes": "some debug info"  // optional free‑form notes
}

The runner (e.g., JokeAgent.run) does not interpret state, text or data; it only persists them.
The moniker (e.g., tell_a_joke) receives a frame_in containing step, state, and optional one‑time guidance, and returns a frame_out that follows the schema above.

Runner Loop (generic)
iteration = 0
step_token = "0"
while True:
    # 1️⃣ Build frame_in (step_token, stored_state, guidance_if_any)
    frame_out = await RunMonikerStep(frame_in, task="tell_a_joke")
    # 2️⃣ Persist snapshot
    await state_updater(
        status="running",
        iteration=iteration,
        step_token=step_token,
        next_step_token=frame_out["next_step"],
        result=frame_out.get("text"),
        context=frame_out.get("state")
    )
    # 3️⃣ Append step history
    await step_appender(iteration, step_token, frame_out)
    # 4️⃣ Stop conditions
    if frame_out.get("done") and self.stop_on_done:
        break
    if iteration >= self.max_steps:
        break
    # 5️⃣ Advance counters
    iteration += 1
    step_token = frame_out["next_step"]
    # 6️⃣ Respect pause / stop flags (already done at top of loop)

Advantages:

Deterministic ordering (iteration),
Human‑readable step tokens (step_token),
Stateless moniker – the runner supplies the stored state each call, enabling easy rehydration.
8. Conversations – First‑class Collaborative Thread (future)
Rationale
A conversation groups multiple agents (each with its own session) and human users into a shared dialogue. Agents can read user messages as guidance, and users can see the agent’s incremental outputs.

Data Model (LanceDB)
Table	Columns
conversations	conversation_id, title, created_by, status, tags, created_at
conversation_participants	conversation_id, entity_type (user / agent), user_id or (agent_id, session_id), role, joined_at, left_at
conversation_messages	message_id, conversation_id, created_at, sender_type (user/agent/system), user_id / agent_id / session_id, text, data (JSON), status, event_type (e.g., interrupt), iteration, step_token, next_step_token, notes
Runtime Hooks
Agent creation can accept a conversation_id. The runtime registers the new (agent_id, session_id) as a participant.
Every iteration the agent also calls append_conversation_message() with sender_type="agent" and the same payload it persisted to agent_steps.
User posting a message (POST /api/conversations/{id}/messages) does:
Append a row to conversation_messages.
Enqueue an agent_interrupt (or a new agent_input) that targets all sessions participating in the conversation (or a specific session, if the UI chooses).
The UI can listen on a Socket.IO room named after the conversation_id to receive both user and agent messages in real‑time.
API Sketch
Method	Path	Description
POST /api/conversations	–	Create a new conversation (title, tags). Returns conversation_id.
GET /api/conversations	–	List all conversations (filter by status, tag, etc.).
POST /api/conversations/{cid}/participants	–	Add a user or agent‑session as a participant.
GET /api/conversations/{cid}/participants	–	List participants.
POST /api/conversations/{cid}/messages	–	User posts a message (text + optional JSON data).
GET /api/conversations/{cid}/messages	–	Paginated transcript (ordered by created_at).
GET /api/conversations/{cid}/messages?since=timestamp	–	Incremental fetch (used by UI for long‑poll / WS).
9. Completed Fixes & Improvements (What’s Already Working)
Issue	Fix
_pause_event AttributeError	Ensured every mixin’s __init__ (or init) is called via super().__init__ in the MRO.
Duplicate dispatch while a handler is still running	IN_FLIGHT_ACTION_IDS set + removal after handler finishes.
Actions sometimes never marked processed	Wrapped each handler body in try … finally: await mark_action_processed_async(...).
Overwrite of the whole agent_state table	Planned change to update‑then‑append (see §5.1).
Late‑binding bug when spawning a task per action	In agents.py use run_one(aid=aid, action=action, handler=handler) to capture current values.
“Task exception was never retrieved” noise	Added a top‑level except Exception as e: print(..., e) inside each handler task.
Poller cadence (~15 s)	Reduce the sleep interval, order rows by created_at ASC (and optionally urgency).
WebSocket server not truly real‑time	Documentation updated to run with socketio.run(app, ...).
JSON fields sometimes stored as plain text	Defensive safe_json_loads added to every get_* helper.
Graceful agent destroy causing hangs	agent_destroy now: if paused → resume, request stop, await task with timeout (default 5 s), cancel if still pending, then cleanup registry entry.
State persistence not yet wired to agent loop	Injected state_updater and step_appender closures during create_agent; called after every iteration.
10. Roadmap – Next Development Phases
Phase 1 – State Upsert & Agent‑Steps
Patch store/agent_state.py to use the update‑then‑append pattern.
Add async wrapper (upsert_state_async) and wire it into JokeAgent.run.
Create agent_steps table (schema shown in §5.2).
Implement append_agent_step + list_agent_steps endpoint (GET /api/agent-steps).
Write unit‑tests that verify:
A step is persisted after each iteration.
The history is append‑only and ordered by iteration.
Phase 2 – Session‑ID End‑to‑End
Extend queue schema (session_id column). Update all agent_*_action helpers to accept a session_id argument (generate a UUID/ULID if omitted).
Modify create_agent to store the session ID on the JokeAgent instance and inject it into the persistence closures.
Add registry structures (SESSIONS, AGENT_LATEST). Update all control handlers (pause, resume, interrupt, destroy) to resolve the target session.
Add HTTP endpoints:
GET /api/agents/<agent_id>/sessions – list sessions.
GET /api/agent-steps?session_id=… – timeline per session.
Test end‑to‑end: create two sessions for the same agent_id, interrupt each independently, verify that steps stay separated.
Phase 3 – Moniker → StepFrame‑v0
Refactor the BAML call tell_a_joke into a generic runner RunMonikerStep(frame_in, task_name).
Update JokeAgent.run to follow the generic loop shown in §7.
Add optional stop_on_done flag (default True for finite monikers, False for continuous ones).
Guard loops with max_steps and/or max_runtime_s to avoid runaway agents.
Verify that:
step_token and next_step_token propagate correctly.
Rehydration (see Phase 5) can resume from the saved next_step_token.
Phase 4 – Conversations
Create the three new LanceDB tables (conversations, conversation_participants, conversation_messages).
Implement the HTTP CRUD endpoints listed in §8.
Extend create_agent to accept optional conversation_id. When present:
Register (agent_id, session_id) as a participant.
Bind a conversation_message_appender closure that writes agent output to conversation_messages.
On a user message (POST /api/conversations/{cid}/messages), enqueue an agent_interrupt (or a new agent_input action) that targets all participant sessions.
Add Socket.IO emissions:
socketio.emit('conversation_update', payload, room=conversation_id).
Verify end‑to‑end: a UI opens a conversation, creates an agent, receives agent jokes, posts a user message, sees the agent change subject accordingly.
Phase 5 – Rehydration & Robustness
On startup of agents.py, query agent_state for rows where status ∈ {running, paused}.
For each row:
Re‑create the corresponding JokeAgent (or generic moniker runner).
Set its internal flags (pause_event, stop_event) based on the saved status.
Start its run() coroutine with iteration = saved_iteration + 1 and step_token = saved_next_step_token.
Improve poller responsiveness:
Reduce await asyncio.sleep(0.5) between polls.
Use WHERE processed = FALSE ORDER BY urgency DESC, created_at ASC.
Add retry & back‑off for handler exceptions: on failure, write status='error', last_error=traceback, and optionally re‑enqueue a “retry” action after a delay.
Add health‑check endpoint (GET /health) that reports the number of live agents, queue length, and DB connection health.
Phase 6 – Observability & UI
Socket.IO events:
agent_state_update (room = session_id).
agent_step (room = session_id).
conversation_message (room = conversation_id).
UI pages:
Agent list → shows latest snapshot (status, iteration, subject).
Session view → step timeline (real‑time scrolling).
Conversation view → combined transcript with both user and agent bubbles.
Export metrics (Prometheus) for:
Number of active agents.
Queue lag (now - oldest_unprocessed.created_at).
Average step latency (latency_ms).
11. Quick Reference – Action Payload Schemas
Action Type	Required payload fields
create_agent	{ "agent_id": str, "initial_subject": str?, "session_id": str? }
agent_pause	{ "agent_id": str, "reason": str?, "session_id": str? }
agent_resume	{ "agent_id": str, "session_id": str? }
agent_interrupt	{ "agent_id": str, "guidance": dict, "session_id": str? }
agent_destroy	{ "agent_id": str, "reason": str?, "session_id": str? }
environment_reload	{ … } (implementation‑specific)
All fields are JSON‑encoded strings when persisted in the LanceDB column.

12. Checklist – “Things to Verify Before Shipping”
 upsert_agent_state uses update‑then‑append (no table overwrite).
 All handlers wrap core logic in try … finally with mark_action_processed_async.
 IN_FLIGHT_ACTION_IDS correctly prevents double‑dispatch.
 JokeAgent respects pause, interrupt, stop flags every iteration.
 State persistence (state_updater) is called after each successful step.
 agent_steps rows are being appended (verify with list_agent_steps).
 Session ID is stored on every queue row, state row, and step row.
 Control actions resolve session correctly when only agent_id is supplied.
 Rehydration on process restart successfully restores paused/running agents.
 Socket.IO events fire and UI receives them in real time.
 Poller latency ≤ 2 seconds under normal load (adjust sleep).
 Error handling: any exception in a handler writes status='error' and does not block the queue.
13. TL;DR – What You Need to Do Right Now
Patch store/agent_state.py to use update‑then‑append.
Wrap that call with an async helper and inject it into JokeAgent (already sketched).
Create the agent_steps table and expose a /api/agent-steps endpoint.
Add session_id to the queue schema and to the agent_create helper (generate a UUID if missing).
Update registries (SESSIONS, AGENT_LATEST) and modify control handlers to accept session_id.
Once those four items are in place you will have a fully observable, multi‑session, queue‑driven agent platform that can be safely restarted, inspected, and extended with conversations and richer monikers. Happy coding!
